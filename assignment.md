## Developer Assignment: "NovaDom" - New Construction Real Estate Platform

**Project Overview:**
NovaDom will be a web application connecting prospective homebuyers directly with developers of new construction projects (apartment buildings, housing complexes). The platform aims to provide a transparent and efficient way for buyers to find new properties without brokers and for developers to generate leads and online traffic. The platform will be worldwide, with an initial launch focus on Bulgaria. It will feature a map-based search, user accounts for saving listings, and a subscription model for developers to list their projects. Developer accounts will require manual verification.

**Core Technologies:**
*   **Backend:** Python 3.9+, FastAPI
*   **ORM:** SQLAlchemy (with Alembic for database migrations)
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (with PostGIS extension for geospatial capabilities)
*   **Frontend:** React (or Vue.js as an alternative, both are well-suited for development with tools like Cursor due to strong tooling and community support)
*   **Map Integration:** Leaflet.js (open-source) or Mapbox GL JS (offers more advanced features, has a free tier)
*   **Payment Gateway:** Stripe (good international support) or a Bulgarian local alternative if preferred for initial launch (e.g., ePay.bg, Borica).
*   **Deployment:** Docker for containerization, with options like AWS, Google Cloud Platform, or a reputable Bulgarian VPS/Cloud provider.
